Some utility programs that may or may not actually be useful.

# Installing
*Note: This is for Windows systems only.*

One useful way to 'install' these programs is to create a folder in your C:/ drive.

_On my dev machine I named it "C:/ProgramUtils"._

Download or clone this repo (Anywhere works.), compile the program youd like to use and take the .exe and place it in your "ProgramUtils" folder.

Edit your Windows PATH variable to include your ProgramUtils folder.

Open your command prompt and enter the programs name to assure that it works.

You're done! I doubt these projects will be useful to others. Most of them are written out of boredom.
